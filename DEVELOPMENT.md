- ✅ Pause menu functionality
- ✅ Lap completion detection and race finish
- ✅ Speed trail effects for high-speed driving

**Controls:**
- `Arrow Keys` or `WASD`: Steering
- `Z` or `SPACE`: Accelerate
- `X` or `SHIFT`: Brake  
- `C` or `CTRL`: Drift (enhanced turning)
- `SPACE`: Use power-up
- `ESC`: Pause menu

#### 4. EndScreen.js
**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Race results display with position-based titles
- ✅ Victory confetti animation for 1st place
- ✅ Statistics summary (lap times, speed, power-ups used)
- ✅ Trophy/medal indicators for different positions
- ✅ Options menu (Race Again, Main Menu, View Replay, Save Ghost)
- ✅ Score progress bar visualization
- ✅ High score entry system (framework ready)

**Controls:**
- `↑/↓`: Navigate options

### 🎨 Visual Style

The game maintains consistent Nintendo-style aesthetics:

- **Colors**: Bright, saturated colors (reds, greens, yellows, cyans)

- **Effects**: Particle systems, speed trails, and animated backgrounds

### 🔊 Audio System

- **Sound Effects**: Procedural 8-bit style beeps using Web Audio API
  - Menu navigation sounds (600-800Hz square waves)
  - Engine sounds (200Hz sawtooth waves)
  - Power-up collection (ascending tone sequence)
- **Music Framework**: Ready for background music integration
- **Volume Controls**: Separate SFX and music volume management

### 🎯 Game Features

**Racing Mechanics:**
- Realistic car physics with acceleration/deceleration
- Drift system with enhanced turning
- Speed-based visual effects
- Collision detection for power-ups

**Power-up System:**
- Speed Boost: Temporary max speed increase
- Shield: Protection framework (ready for expansion)
- Visual indicators and collection feedback

**AI System:**
- Simple track-following behavior
- Multiple AI cars with different speeds
- Position tracking and display

### 🚀 Running the Game

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local development server
npm start

# Game will open at http://localhost:8080
```

### 🛠️ Development Features

Debug console commands available:
```javascript
// Quick scene switching
gameDebug.switchScene('intro')
