## Usage

### Basic Setup

```javascript
import { createBalanceManager } from './src/index.js';

// Create a balance manager with default configuration
const balanceManager = createBalanceManager({
    enableDynamicAdjustment: true,
    enableRealTimeMonitoring: true,
    autoOptimization: false
});

// Start a gaming session
const sessionId = balanceManager.startSession({
    difficulty: 'normal',
    gameMode: 'championship',
    playerProfile: {
        skillLevel: 'intermediate',
        playtime: 3600000 // 1 hour in milliseconds
    }
});
```

### Processing Race Results

```javascript
// Process a completed race
const raceResult = balanceManager.processRaceCompletion({
    participants: [
        {
            id: 'player1',
            isPlayer: true,
            finalPosition: 2,
            finalTime: 125000,
            powerupsUsed: 3,
            driftsCompleted: 8,
            mistakesMade: 1,
            averageSpeed: 95
        },
        // ... AI participants
    ],
    duration: 125000,
    track: 'rainbow_road',
    difficulty: 'normal'
});

console.log(`Player finished in position ${raceResult.playerPerformance.position}`);
console.log(`Difficulty adjusted to: ${raceResult.difficultyAdjustment.effective}`);
```

### Real-time Adjustments

```javascript
// Apply real-time balance adjustments
balanceManager.applyRealTimeAdjustment('ai_skill', {
    skillLevel: 0.8
});

balanceManager.applyRealTimeAdjustment('powerup_spawn', {
    spawnRate: 1.2
});

// Handle emergency situations
balanceManager.handleEmergencyAdjustment('player_frustration', {
    type: 'reduce_difficulty'
});
```

### Analytics and Reporting

```javascript
// Collect player feedback
balanceManager.collectPlayerFeedback({
    type: 'difficulty',
    rating: 4,
    comments: 'Perfect balance!'
});

// Generate comprehensive balance report
const report = balanceManager.generateBalanceReport(true);
console.log(`Player win rate: ${report.playerAnalysis.winRate}`);
console.log(`Balance assessment: ${report.playerAnalysis.balanceAssessment}`);

// Get current balance configuration
const config = balanceManager.getCurrentBalanceConfig();
console.log(`Current difficulty: ${config.level.level}`);
console.log(`AI skill level: ${config.parameters.ai.skillLevel}`);
```

## Nintendo-Style Design Principles

The balance system follows Nintendo's game design philosophy:

### Accessibility
- **Helpful AI**: Computer opponents that challenge without frustrating
- **Forgiving Physics**: Slightly more lenient collision and handling
- **Clear Feedback**: Immediate visual and audio response to player actions
- **Progressive Challenge**: Gradual difficulty increase that matches player growth

### Fairness
- **Balanced Catch-up**: Rubber-banding that feels natural, not artificial
- **Equal Power-ups**: Fair distribution of power-ups among all participants
- **Skill-based Matching**: Difficulty adjustment based on demonstrated player skill
- **Respect Player Time**: No unfairly difficult spikes that waste player progress

### Fun Factor
- **High Reward Frequency**: Regular positive reinforcement and achievements
- **Mistake Tolerance**: Allow players to recover from errors
- **Comeback Opportunities**: Always provide chances for exciting finishes
- **Success Celebration**: Highlight and reward player accomplishments

## Configuration Options

### Difficulty Levels

**Easy Mode**:
- 20% faster player acceleration
- 10% higher top speed
- 30% better handling
- AI makes 20% more mistakes
- 30% more power-ups
- 60% catch-up assistance

**Normal Mode** (Default):
- Balanced parameters for average players
- Standard AI skill and behavior
- Moderate catch-up assistance (40%)
- Regular power-up distribution

**Hard Mode**:
- 10% reduced player acceleration
- 5% lower top speed
- 20% more challenging handling
- AI makes 50% fewer mistakes
- 30% fewer power-ups
- Minimal catch-up assistance (20%)

### Dynamic Adjustment Parameters

```javascript
{
    enableDynamicAdjustment: true,    // Enable/disable automatic difficulty adjustment
    targetWinRate: 0.4,               // Target player win rate (40%)
    adjustmentRate: 0.1,              // How quickly to adjust difficulty
    performanceWindow: 10,            // Number of races to consider for adjustment
    autoOptimization: false,          // Enable automatic parameter optimization
    monitoringInterval: 30000         // Real-time monitoring frequency (30 seconds)
}
```

## Integration Guidelines

### Game Engine Integration

1. **Initialize the balance manager** at game startup
2. **Start a session** when the player begins racing
3. **Process race completions** to feed data to the system
4. **Apply real-time adjustments** during gameplay
5. **Collect player feedback** through UI elements
6. **Monitor system health** using analytics reports

### Event Handling

The balance manager emits events for integration:

```javascript
balanceManager.on('raceCompleted', (data) => {
    // Update UI with performance metrics
    updatePerformanceUI(data.playerPerformance);
});

balanceManager.on('difficultyAdjusted', (data) => {
    // Notify player of difficulty changes
    showDifficultyNotification(data.newLevel);
});

balanceManager.on('emergencyAdjustment', (data) => {
    // Handle emergency balance interventions
    handleEmergencyFeedback(data.reason);
});
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Monitoring Frequency**: Default 30-second intervals balance responsiveness with performance
- **Data Retention**: Automatic cleanup of old race data to prevent memory bloat
- **Async Processing**: Use event-driven architecture to avoid blocking game loops
- **Configuration Caching**: Parameters are cached and only recalculated when needed
